**inert** provides new [handler](https://github.com/hapijs/hapi/blob/master/API.md#serverhandlername-method)
methods for serving static files and directories, as well as adding a `h.file()` method to the
[toolkit](https://github.com/hapijs/hapi/blob/master/API.md#response-toolkit), which can respond with
file based resources.

## Features

 * Files are served with cache friendly `last-modified` and `etag` headers.
 * Generated file listings and custom indexes.
 * Pre-compressed file support for `content-encoding: gzip` responses.
 * File attachment support using `content-disposition`  header.

## Examples

**inert** enables a number of common use cases for serving static assets.

### Static file server

The following creates a basic static file server that can be used to serve html content from the
`public` directory on port 3000:

```js
const Path = require('path');
const Hapi = require('@hapi/hapi');
const Inert = require('@hapi/inert');

const server = new Hapi.Server({
    port: 3000,
    routes: {
        files: {
            relativeTo: Path.join(__dirname, 'public')
        }
    }
});

const provision = async () => {

    await server.register(Inert);

    server.route({
        method: 'GET',
        path: '/{param*}',
        handler: {
            directory: {
                path: '.',
                redirectToSlash: true,
                index: true,
            }
        }
    });

    await server.start();

    console.log('Server running at:', server.info.uri);
};

provision();
```

### Serving a single file

You can serve specific files using the `file` handler:

```js
server.route({
    method: 'GET',
    path: '/{path*}',
    handler: {
        file: 'page.html'
    }
});
```

### Customized file response

If you need more control, the `h.file()` method is available to use inside handlers:

```js
server.route({
    method: 'GET',
    path: '/file',
    handler(request, h) {

        let path = 'plain.txt';
        if (request.headers['x-magic'] === 'sekret') {
            path = 'awesome.png';
        }

        return h.file(path).vary('x-magic');
    }
});

server.ext('onPreResponse', (request, h) => {

    const response = request.response;
    if (response.isBoom &&
        response.output.statusCode === 404) {

        return h.file('404.html').code(404);
    }

    return h.continue;
});
```

## Usage

After registration, this plugin adds a new method to the `toolkit` object and exposes the `'file'`
and `'directory'` route handlers.

Note that **inert** uses the custom `'file'` `variety` to signal that the response is a static
file generated by this plugin.

### Server options

**inert** handles the following server plugin options on `plugins.inert`:

  - `etagsCacheMaxSize` - sets the maximum number of file etag hash values stored in the
    etags cache. Defaults to `1000`.

### `h.file(path, [options])`

Transmits a file from the file system. The 'Content-Type' header defaults to the matching mime
type based on filename extension.:

  - `path` - the file path.
  - `options` - optional settings:
      - `confine` - serve file relative to this directory and returns `403 Forbidden` if the
        `path` resolves outside the `confine` directory.
        Defaults to `true` which uses the `relativeTo` route option as the `confine`.
        Set to `false` to disable this security feature.
      - `filename` - an optional filename to specify if sending a 'Content-Disposition' header,
        defaults to the basename of `path`
      - `mode` - specifies whether to include the 'Content-Disposition' header with the response.
        Available values:
          - `false` - header is not included. This is the default value.
          - `'attachment'`
          - `'inline'`
      - `lookupCompressed` - if `true`, looks for for a pre-compressed version of the file with
        the same filename with an extension, depending on the accepted encoding.
        Defaults to `false`.
      - `lookupMap` - an `object` which maps content encoding to expected file name extension.
        Defaults to `{ gzip: '.gz' }`.
      - `etagMethod` - specifies the method used to calculate the `ETag` header response.
        Available values:
          - `'hash'` - SHA1 sum of the file contents, suitable for distributed deployments.
            Default value.
          - `'simple'` - Hex encoded size and modification date, suitable when files are stored
            on a single server.
          - `false` - Disable ETag computation.
      - `start` - offset in file to reading from, defaults to 0.
      - `end` - offset in file to stop reading from. If not set, will read to end of file.

Returns a standard [response](https://github.com/hapijs/hapi/blob/master/API.md#response-object) object.

The [response flow control rules](https://github.com/hapijs/hapi/blob/master/API.md#flow-control) **do not** apply.

### The `file` handler

Generates a static file endpoint for serving a single file. `file` can be set to:
  - a relative or absolute file path string (relative paths are resolved based on the
    route [`files`](https://github.com/hapijs/hapi/blob/master/API.md#route.config.files)
    configuration).
  - a function with the signature `function(request)` which returns the relative or absolute
    file path.
  - an object with one or more of the following options:
      - `path` - a path string or function as described above (required).
      - `confine` - serve file relative to this directory and returns `403 Forbidden` if the
        `path` resolves outside the `confine` directory.
        Defaults to `true` which uses the `relativeTo` route option as the `confine`.
        Set to `false` to disable this security feature.
      - `filename` - an optional filename to specify if sending a 'Content-Disposition'
        header, defaults to the basename of `path`
      - `mode` - specifies whether to include the 'Content-Disposition' header with the
        response. Available values:
          - `false` - header is not included. This is the default value.
          - `'attachment'`
          - `'inline'`
      - `lookupCompressed` - if `true`, looks for for a pre-compressed version of the file with
        the same filename with an extension, depending on the accepted encoding.
        Defaults to `false`.
      - `lookupMap` - an `object` which maps content encoding to expected file name extension.
        Defaults to `{ gzip: '.gz' }`.
      - `etagMethod` - specifies the method used to calculate the `ETag` header response.
        Available values:
          - `'hash'` - SHA1 sum of the file contents, suitable for distributed deployments.
            Default value.
          - `'simple'` - Hex encoded size and modification date, suitable when files are stored
            on a single server.
          - `false` - Disable ETag computation.
      - `start` - offset in file to reading from, defaults to 0.
      - `end` - offset in file to stop reading from. If not set, will read to end of file.

### The `directory` handler

Generates a directory endpoint for serving static content from a directory.
Routes using the directory handler must include a path parameter at the end of the path
string (e.g. `/path/to/somewhere/{param}` where the parameter name does not matter). The
path parameter can use any of the parameter options (e.g. `{param}` for one level files
only, `{param?}` for one level files or the directory root, `{param*}` for any level, or
`{param*3}` for a specific level). If additional path parameters are present, they are
ignored for the purpose of selecting the file system resource. The directory handler is an
object with the following options:
  - `path` - (required) the directory root path (relative paths are resolved based on the
    route [`files`](https://github.com/hapijs/hapi/blob/master/API.md#route.config.files)
    configuration). Value can be:
      - a single path string used as the prefix for any resources requested by appending the
        request path parameter to the provided string.
      - an array of path strings. Each path will be attempted in order until a match is
        found (by following the same process as the single path string).
      - a function with the signature `function(request)` which returns the path string or
        an array of path strings. If the function returns an error, the error is passed back
        to the client in the response.
  - `index` - optional boolean|string|string[], determines if an index file will be served
    if found in the folder when requesting a directory. The given string or strings specify
    the name(s) of the index file to look for. If `true`, looks for 'index.html'. Any falsy
    value disables index file lookup. Defaults to `true`.
  - `listing` - optional boolean, determines if directory listing is generated when a
    directory is requested without an index document.
    Defaults to `false`.
  - `showHidden` - optional boolean, determines if hidden files will be shown and served.
    Defaults to `false`.
  - `redirectToSlash` - optional boolean, determines if requests for a directory without a
    trailing slash are redirected to the same path with the missing slash. Useful for
    ensuring relative links inside the response are resolved correctly. Disabled when the
    server config `router.stripTrailingSlash` is `true. `Defaults to `false`.
  - `lookupCompressed` - optional boolean, instructs the file processor to look for the same
    filename with an extension, depending on the accepted encoding, for a pre-compressed
    version of the file to serve. Defaults to `false`.
  - `lookupMap` - an `object` which maps content encoding to expected file name extension.
    Defaults to `{ gzip: '.gz' }`.
  - `etagMethod` - specifies the method used to calculate the `ETag` header response.
    Available values:
      - `'hash'` - SHA1 sum of the file contents, suitable for distributed deployments.
        Default value.
      - `'simple'` - Hex encoded size and modification date, suitable when files are stored
        on a single server.
      - `false` - Disable ETag computation.
  - `defaultExtension` - optional string, appended to file requests if the requested file is
    not found. Defaults to no extension.

### Errors

Any file access errors are signalled using appropriate [Boom](https://github.com/hapijs/boom)
errors. These are `Boom.notFound()` for missing or hidden files, and `Boom.forbidden()` for
files that exist, but can't otherwise be accessed.

The error can contain an `err.data.path` property, which is the path that the error failed for.
This property *does not always exist* if the response was generated without a file system lookup,
and for the directory handler it will be the last tested non-index path.

If an unexpected configuration or processing errors occurs, `Boom.internal()` and `'system'`
errors can also be thrown.
